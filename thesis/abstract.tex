When dealing with large scale disturbances occurring on a network a higher level view is difficult to obtain by just examining failure at the component level. Knowing how individual components fail does not provide insight into the overall failure mode of the system. This work attempts to provide a higher level perspective of the failure modes in an electrical power network model by predicting the size of blackout events.
