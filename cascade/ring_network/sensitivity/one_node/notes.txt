The simulation creates a ring network of nodes. The number of connections
each node has is sorted by folder. The uniform rv loading of each node is 
indicated by the file name D_###. 
The simulation then inserts a load NF on a random node and checks for any node
failures d >= z_crit. That node is now in a failed state and passes NF load to
all of the nodes its connected to. The nodes still active will then check
their load and perform the same action. For each data set this simulation is
run 10,000 times. The number of failures is then put into a histogram (the D_# files)
